# Urban sprawl and land use change 🏙️{.center}

## 🤔 What is urban sprawl?
- Urban sprawl is the uncontrolled expansion of urban areas, often leading to land use change and habitat fragmentation.
- Role of GIS & Satellite Data : 
  - Analyze high-resolution satellite images (e.g., Sentinel-2, Landsat) to detect changes in land use over time.
  - Use land classification algorithms (e.g., supervised classification, NDVI) to map urban expansion.
  - Visualize sprawl patterns using GIS tools to inform policymakers.

## 💪🏼 Plan of action{.scrollable}
- Get imagery from 2016 and 2024 from sentinel 2 and Landsat for RD circle region as pilot
- Identify Land use for both imageries in 4 main categories (Using Random Forest Classification)
  - Urban
  - Barren
  - Forest/Agriculture
  - Water
- Urban Sprawl Prediction for 2036 as per DP plan
  - Using spatial factors like elevation, slope, distance from roads, and distance from current built-up areas 
  - Use multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLPNNs)  


## 😎 How can this be useful?
- we get following answers from this analysis
  - How & Where the built up area will increase over time?
  - What Infrastructure arrangements should we prepare for the future?
  - Utilising barren lands for green spaces?
- These models can be used while preparing next master plan for the city by doing simluations of road network and urban growth
  
# Heat Island Effect Analysis

## 🤔 What is Heat Island Effect (HIE)?{.smaller}

- Heat Island Effect (HIE) is a phenomenon where urban areas experience higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas due to urbanization.
- Role of GIS & Satellite Data :
  - Use thermal imagery from Landsat 8 (TIR bands) or Sentinel 3 (OLI bands) to detect changes in land use over time.
  - Map LST variations across urban areas and identify heat island hotspots.
  - Integrate NDVI and land cover data to correlate vegetation loss with increased temperatures.

## 💪🏼 Plan of action{.scrollable}
- Get latest imagery from multiple satellites for College Road and Gangapur region as pilot
- Apply atmospheric corrections.
- Generate LST maps to identify hotspots.
- Correlate LST with LULC types to pinpoint heat contributors.
- Compare satellite LST with ground data (if available).
- Create thematic maps showing UHI intensity zones.

## 😎 How can this be useful?
- Identify and mitigate heat-prone areas in cities.
- Support policies for reducing heat-related health risks.
- Focus on areas needing urgent cooling interventions.
- Align city planning with global sustainability goals.


# Illegal built up detection

## 🤔 What is Illegal built up?
- Illegal built up is a term used to describe construction activities that are not permitted in a particular area.
- Role of GIS & Satellite Data : 
  - Analyze high-resolution satellite images (e.g., Sentinel-2, Landsat) to detect changes in land use over time.
  - Use land classification algorithms (e.g., supervised classification, NDVI) to map urban footprints.
  - GIS system for municipalities to visualizr and take action on illegal built up.

## 💪🏼 Plan of action{.scrollable}
- Get latest imagery from multiple satellites for Satpur, Ambad, Pathardi Phata region as pilot
- Compute LULC and NDVI for each imagery
- Overlay with existing building footprints ( if available )
- Superimpose with master plan of the city to identify construction zones
- Run analysis to identify illegal built up

## 😎 How can this be useful?
- Identify illegal built up activities on real time basis
- Easy access of such building footprints for municipalities
- Complete solution to maintain records of urban development and action taken against it. 
- Run model on monthly basis to identify illegal built up and take action

# GIS data crowdsourcing

## 🤔 Why we need this?
- At the moment, there is a lack of open dataset about Nashik city. 
- This is a problem because the city is growing rapidly and there is a need for better planning and management of the city.
- Using this data, we can identify the areas that are in need of urgent attention and take action to improve the city.
- Government as well as private organizations can use this data to identify areas that need improvement and take action to improve the city.

## 💪🏼 Plan of action{.scrollable}
- Conduct few workshops on college level to let students know about how they can contribute to this project
- Start contribution mechanism to crowdsource data on OpenStreetMap platform as well as maintaining data at NMC level
- Award contributors with certificates of completion or monetary rewards
- Create a portal following the Open Data principles to make the data available to the public

## 😎 How can this be useful?
- Improve the quality of the data
- Allowing public to access the data to create various use cases
- Use this data for better planning and management of the city
